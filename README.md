# EduBot: The library for manipulators for Education

This repository contains the drivers, visualization features and a simple simulation for [LeRobot](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot) (and for legacy reasons also the [Lynxmotion AL5A Arm](https://wiki.lynxmotion.com/info/wiki/lynxmotion/view/servo-erector-set-robots-kits/ses-v1-robots/ses-v1-arms/al5a/), in its designated branch), all of which are implemented using the [ROS2](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html) middleware.

## Installation

### Pre-requisites

To compile the pre-requisites are `ROS 2` and `boost`.

#### For Ubuntu 22.04 users: Install ROS 2 Humble:
ROS 2 Humble (LTS) can be installed for ubuntu (>= 22.04) as explained in the [ROS 2 documentation](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html). 
Additional prerequisites are found [here](#for-virtual-machine-users) if you're using a Virtual Machine.
The easiest way is to add the sources and install via apt

        # Add the ROS 2 GPG key with apt.
        sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl -y
        sudo curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key -o /usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg 

        # Add the repository to your sources list.
        echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release && echo $UBUNTU_CODENAME) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2.list > /dev/null

        # Update the sources
        sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade

        # Finally install ros and ros-dev tools
        sudo apt install ros-humble-desktop ros-dev-tools

Make sure the additional ros libraries are installed

        sudo apt install ros-humble-xacro ros-humble-joint-state-publisher ros-humble-joint-state-publisher-gui
        # Install pip if not yet installed
        sudo apt-get install python3-pip
        # Install python pkg dependency
        pip install catkin_pkg

#### For Ubuntu 24.04 users Install ROS 2 Jazzy:
ROS 2 Jazzy (LTS) can be installed for ubuntu (>= 24.04) as explained in the [ROS 2 documentation](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debs.html). 
Additional prerequisites are found [here](#for-virtual-machine-users) if you're using a Virtual Machine.
The easiest way is to add the sources and install via apt

        # Add the ROS 2 GPG key with apt.
        sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl -y
        zsudo curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key -o /usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg

        # Add the repository to your sources list.
        echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release && echo $UBUNTU_CODENAME) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2.list > /dev/null

        # Update the sources
        sudo apt update

        # Finally install ros and ros-dev tools
        sudo apt install ros-dev-tools ros-jazzy-desktop

Make sure the additional ros libraries are installed

        sudo apt install ros-jazzy-xacro ros-jazzy-joint-state-publisher ros-jazzy-joint-state-publisher-gui
        # Install pip if not yet installed
        sudo apt-get install python3-pip
        # Install python pkg dependency (global)
        sudo apt-get install python-catkin_pkg

#### For both 22.04 and 24.04

The required `boost` libraries are installed via

        sudo apt install libboost-all-dev

Finally, clone this repository recursively

        git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/bioMorphic-Intelligence-Lab/edubot

To allow the `ROS` program to access the USB port connected to the eduBot you will also have to add the current user to the dialout group

        sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER

### Compilation

The repository contains two folders: `ros_ws` and `testing`.
The former contains the driver, visualization, simulation and a simple control example of the robot (in C++ and python) while the latter only contains plain testing scrips. 
You can choose which language you would like to write your controller in using the code provided as an initial guideline.
To compile the ROS workspace, source your ROS installation and call the `colcon` build command as follows:

        cd edubot/ros_ws

        # For ROS 2 Humble users
        source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
        
        # For ROS 2 Jazzy users
        source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
        
        # Call build command
        colcon build

### Python package setup (`python_controllers`)

If you only want to setup the Python controller package, build it directly:

        cd edubot/ros_ws

        # Source one ROS installation
        source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
        # or
        source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash

        # Build only the python package
        colcon build --packages-select python_controllers

        # Source local workspace after build
        source install/setup.bash

        # Verify entry points
        ros2 run python_controllers example_pos_traj
        # or
        ros2 run python_controllers example_vel_traj

### Running

Once the package is compiled, source by calling:

      # Source the local setup
      source install/setup.bash

You can run start the simulation or the driver for the robot with the following commands

 Command                            |  Effect 
------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------
`ros2 launch lerobot sim_position.launch.py`  |  Launches the simulation and `rviz` visualization with the robot in position control mode
`ros2 launch lerobot sim_velocity.launch.py`  |  Launches the simulation and `rviz` visualization with the robot in velocity control mode
`ros2 launch lerobot rviz.launch.py` |  Launches the `rviz` visualization and a joint position interface which lets you play with the robot
`ros2 launch lerobot hw_position.launch.py`  |  Launches the hardware interface with the robot in position control mode
`ros2 launch lerobot hw_velocity.launch.py`  |  Launches the hardware interface with the robot in velocity control mode
`ros2 run controllers example_traj` |  Starts the cpp controller that commands a periodic example trajectory
`ros2 run python_controllers example_pos_traj`  | Starts the python controller for periodic example position trajectory
`ros2 run python_controllers example_vel_traj`  | Starts the python controller for periodic example velocity trajectory

### For Virtual Machine Users

Download and install both **VirtualBox** and **VirtualBox Extension Pack** from [their website](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads). Ensure that both have the same versions. If you have a virtual machine already running, first power it off before installing the Extension Pack and proceeding.

Go to **Virtual Machine Settings > USB**, check **Enable USB Controller** and the corresponding USB type. In my case it was **USB 3.0 (xHCI) Controller**. 

Connect the (1) robot's USB connector, (2) power the robot motors, and then (3) power on virtual machine. Every time you open a new terminal, source your `ros` installation and call the `colcon` compilation, as stated above.

Verify that the virtual machine can read the USB by listing files and directories that starts with **ttyUSB-**

        ls -l /dev/ttyUSB*

If you get a **permission denied** error such as [this](https://support.termius.com/hc/en-us/articles/6325078649753-When-trying-to-make-a-serial-connection-I-get-a-Permission-denied-error#:~:text=Most%20'Permission%20denied'%20error%20messages,identify%20the%20serial%20port%20path.&text=The%20next%20step%20is%20to,running%20the%20command%20provided%20below.) add your user account to the appropriate group by

        sudo usermod -a $USER -G dialout

Log in and log out user account and then try again. Don't forget to source.

**Important**: If the USB still cannot be read, unplug everything and kill all ROS processes, (1) power the virtual machine, (2) power ON the robot emergency switch, (3) plug in the USB connector, (4) plug in power for motors.
